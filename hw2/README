===========
Compilation
===========

"make" gives the program "wireframe"

"make clean" removes the intermediate files generated during compilation.

=====
Usage
=====

This is a 3-D wireframe renderer that reads input in OpenInventor format 
from stdin and writes the image in the PPM format to stdout.

Example: ./wireframe [xRes] [yRes] < [input data]
         ./wireframe [xRes] [yRes] < [input data] > [name.ppm]

Here xRes and yRes are the size of the image to be made.

Conversion to more popular image formats is also possible.

Example: ./wireframe [xRes] [yRes] < [input data] | convert - [name.png]
         ./wireframe [xRes] [yRes] < [input data] | convert - [name.jpg]
